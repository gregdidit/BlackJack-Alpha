# BlackJack-Alpha
This is project of blackjack made in JavaScript

This project was help me understand the basics of Javascript working through the logic.
Also it was good way for me to use git and github.


Edit: 21/6/22 - This is Blackjack v.1

I've never coded in JavaScript before and it's taken me about 2 and half months to complete this game project from knowing little to nothing.

I bring what I know from coding in C# to here.

This is my first public release of game on git/git-hub.

Please ignore the other files and just focus on the "blackjackFinal.js" file

This code is live on my website and works fine the rest of the other files was for testing so use at your own risk.

I've commented my code if you want to use it for yourself.

Again I note, I was just focused on the .js file

Enjoy
